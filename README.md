## 👋 Introduction 
Enhanced Battleship Game is a Java-based implementation of the classic naval warfare game, enriched with unique features like special ability cards and custom ship types. Developed as a 3-month learning project at Mindera School, it demonstrates core programming concepts through an engaging gaming experience.

## 💻 Technologies
* Java
* JavaFX
* CSS
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Notion (Project Planning & Documentation)
* Eraser (Mockups & Visual Planning)
* Git (Version Control)

## ✨ Features
* **Enhanced Gameplay Mechanics**
  - Multiple board sizes (10x10, 15x15, 20x20)
  - Turn-based combat with hit-streak rewards
  - Manual or random ship placement

* **Special Ability Cards**
  - CrossStrike: 2x2 area attack
  - QuadShot: 4 random shots
  - Sonar: 3x3 area ship detection
  - SkipTurn: Skip enemy's next turn

* **Custom Ship Types**
  - Cloud Ruler (Size 5)
  - Convoy Shepherd (Size 4)
  - Abyssal Assassin (Size 3)
  - Dauntless Defender (Size 3)
  - Shellfire Juggernaut (Size 2)

* **Visual Feedback System**
  - Emoji-based board representation
  - 🌊 (Water) 💩 (Miss) 🎯 (Hit) 🫠 (Sunk) 🚢 (Ship) 🔍 (Sonar)
  - Dynamic UI updates

## 🛠️ Development Process
1. **Planning & Design**
   - Project scope definition in Notion
   - UI/UX wireframing in Eraser
   - Game mechanics planning

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Game logic architecture
   - Ship and card systems
   - State management 
   - Board validation logic

3. **UI Development**
   - JavaFX screen implementation
   - Component development
   - Visual feedback system
   - CSS styling

4. **Testing & Refinement**
   - Gameplay mechanics testing
   - Bug fixes and optimizations

## 🎓 Key Learnings
* **OOP Principles**
  - Inheritance through Ship and Card systems
  - Encapsulation for game state management
  - Polymorphism in card abilities

* **UI Development**
  - JavaFX framework usage
  - Event handling implementation
  - Dynamic UI updates

* **Code Organization**
  - Package structure design
  - Code modularity
  - Component reusability

* **Problem Solving**
  - Ship placement validation
  - Game state tracking
  - Turn management logic

## 🚀 Best Practices Implemented
* **Clean Architecture**
  - Separation of UI and game logic
  - Clear class responsibilities
  - Modular component design

* **Code Quality**
  - Consistent naming conventions
  - Comprehensive documentation
  - DRY principle adherence

* **Performance Optimization**
  - Efficient data structures usage
  - Optimized board updates
  - Resource management

## 📈 Areas for Improvement
* **Feature Expansion**
  - Network multiplayer capability
  - AI opponent implementation
  - Additional special abilities
  - Statistics tracking system

* **Technical Enhancements**
  - Sound effects integration
  - Save/Load game functionality
  - Settings customization

## 📘 Usage
1. Launch the game
2. Select board size and ship quantity
3. Choose placement method (manual/random)
4. Place ships according to rules
5. Use regular attacks and special cards
6. Sink all enemy ships to win
